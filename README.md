# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for making this study guide was to make sure that I am prepared as possible for my Boot Camp coursework for coding. I built this website to make an easily accessible source of notes to help me problem solve if I forget how to do something or forget what a certain word means. This website makes it so I have a reliable source for information. Through the building of this website I was able to retain a decent amount of knowledge for basic website construction through only coding.
